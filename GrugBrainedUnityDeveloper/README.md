# Grug-brained Unity Developer

## Packages, Custom Gameplay Frameworks
Grug is dumb and simple mind, packages and gameplay frameworks that need to learned other paradigms to works with is hard.
So Grug only too existed solutions from Unity and simple gameplay frameworks, or write simple versions only.
Things that Grug use:
- Unity Engine Core
- URP, but BiRP still preferred from beginning (easily convert BiRP to URP)
- TopDown Engine and Feel: usable solutions, good performance on mobile
- Unity uGUI
- Unity Cinemachine
- Unity AI Navigation
- Unity Timeline
- Unity Addressables
- Scriptable Objects
- UniTask: purely simple and easy to use, just replace Task with UniTask in C# code
- In-game Debug Console: like above, the only things we need to put prefab into scene

Things Grug avoid to use:
- Game Creator: too much things need to learn, performance are bad on mobile
- Unity DOTS: difference paradigms to work with, not mature enoughs. Hard to work with GameObjects system.
- Unity UI Toolkit: many things to learn, hard to do animations, tweening are hard

## Scripting
Grug follow Simplicity C# approachs.

## Tooling
When existing tool works, Grug use it. When need to write somethings new, Grug just write some script that works.
Avoid Unity UI Toolkit, just do ImGui that works.

## Content creation 
Grug like WYSIWYG approach, it's truthly help much. Grug are dumb, and cant afford perfections, so Grug just create, review, modify, or create new. Repeat until it's worked like Grug want. This approach including in all manner of content creations: character, level, environment, animation, story, dialogue, quest, and after all scripting. Some best practices Grug thought that good:
- When creating character: create a character scene, like trainning room in esport games. Change data, replay, repat
