# Simplicity Coding Style in C# for Unity

## Simple rules
- Avoid deep hierarchy, multi-connected classes
- Prefer dumb data, simple struct when doing logic processing
- Prefer simple and works functions when doing computings
- Avoid metaprogramming, reflection when you dont need it
- Make the code the problem at hands, so study your problems before do coding
- Use concrete solutions first, only use abstractions when you need it

## Same techniques, ideas
- Orthodox C++
- Compression-oriented Programming
- Grug-brained Developer
- Odin and other modern better C languages
- Beef Programming Language (C# syntaxes with Orthodox C++ semantics)

## Topics need deep dive
- Delegates, lambdas, closures
- Avoid GC: structs, pooling, avoid lambda bindings if available, native collections
- Data oriented in C#
- When common "Clean Code" approachs failed
- Unity GameObjects, Components, how to use its in simplicity way
