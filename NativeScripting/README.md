# Introduction
Deep dive intro how C# work, and doing weird stuffs with C++ for native scripting.
Only for fun, but after all, if we have more tools, more ideas, our product maybe and only maybe better.
For fun and profit, brother!

## Tech and design goals, philosiphy
- This project will work on C++ first (exactly Orthodox C++). Other languages maybe later, and write some comparision with C++.
